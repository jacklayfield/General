Here is a super basic intro level machine learning project I completed years ago (~2020). It was one of the first projects I completed! It uses PyTorch + MNIST database and is a great introduction to Neural Networks! <br />

I beleive I followed a tutorial to guide me when I first did this but I'd have to look for it. <br />

There were a few fixes and organizational things I added.<br />

This is a very straighforward mini project but also a great refresher of the basics of PyTorch! <br />

I beleive at minimum to run this you will need PyTorch 2.0.0 and TorchVision. You can install them via pip with the following commands: <br/>

pip install torch==2.0.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html <br />
pip install torchvision <br />
